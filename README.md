Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning-based approach to detect lung cancer using image data. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify lung X-ray/CT images into cancerous or non-cancerous categories.

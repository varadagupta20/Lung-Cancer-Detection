Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning-based approach to detect lung cancer using image data. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify lung X-ray/CT images into cancerous or non-cancerous categories.

ðŸ“Œ Features

End-to-end deep learning pipeline
Image preprocessing and augmentation
Model training and evaluation
Accuracy and loss visualization
Final model prediction on test data

ðŸ§ª Dataset

The model is trained and tested on lung X-ray or CT scan images.
The dataset is from Kaggle named as 'the-iqothnccd-lung-cancer-dataset'.

Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow & Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV (optional)
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook


ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

The model demonstrates strong performance with training and validation accuracy above 90% after sufficient epochs. Loss and accuracy trends are visualized in the notebook.
